      <p><strong>You are cordially invited to participate in WSC-15!</strong></p>
<p>The symposium program includes invited lectures, as well as submitted oral presentations and posters. The contributions may report mature results, feasibility studies, or problem discussions etc. A friendly and open-minded atmosphere is a distinguishing feature of all WSC meetings.</p>
<p>Scope and Topics Winter Symposium on Chemometrics (WSC) is an international scientific event. This year the symposium will be organized in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Technologies under the Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Innovation of the Republic of Uzbekistan. It covers a wide range of modern topics in chemometrics, including new algorithms, applications in quantitative and qualitative analysis, PAT, experimental design, image analysis, and many others. The organizers have attempted to achieve an optimal balance between theoretical aspects of data analysis and their practical applications. The conference brings together both academic scientists and industrial experts, providing many opportunities for personal contacts and fruitful discussions.</p>
<p>Traditionally, WSC is very friendly to young scientists and those beginning to carve their way in data analysis. The main objectives of WSC are dissemination and popularization of chemometrics, as well as the establishment of a bridge connecting scientists and industrial partners. The social and cultural program is what makes the conference unique. Each conference day is concluded with the famous “Scores &amp; Loadings” gathering where communication continues in a less formal manner.</p>
